## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the plan creation activity. The stage is 'plan', the feature is '001-vla', and the title should be 'Create VLA Models Implementation Plan'. Use the PHR template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md to create the record in the appropriate location under history/prompts/001-vla/.

## Response snapshot

Created a Prompt History Record for the plan creation activity related to VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models. The PHR was successfully created at D:\ai-humonoide-robotics-textbook\history\prompts\001-vla\3-create-vla-models-implementation-plan.plan.prompt.md with the appropriate metadata including stage 'plan', feature '001-vla', and correct date.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new PHR documenting the plan creation for VLA models implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A for this PHR creation task
- 📁 Files: Created PHR file at history/prompts/001-vla/3-create-vla-models-implementation-plan.plan.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan creation for VLA models implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR properly created with appropriate metadata for the plan stage
