## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the ADR creation activity. The stage is 'adr', the feature is '001-vla', and the title should be 'Create VLA Educational Content Architecture ADR'. Use the PHR template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md to create the record in the appropriate location under history/prompts/001-vla/.

## Response snapshot

I have created a Prompt History Record for the ADR creation activity. The record is located at D:\ai-humonoide-robotics-textbook\history\prompts\001-vla\2-create-vla-educational-content-architecture-adr.adr.prompt.md with ID 2, stage 'adr', feature '001-vla', and title 'Create VLA Educational Content Architecture ADR'.
